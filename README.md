# low-field-MRI-reconstruction
This is part of my work for my bachelor thesis.

A WaCAEN model trained to deal with aliasing and blurring in Low-Field MRI.

## Results on validation set for Aliasing

## Results on Low-Field MRI from a Cuban Hospital
These pictures were taken in a Cuban Hospital and were not part of the training dataset. 
The model shows some great results recovering images afected by blurring.
